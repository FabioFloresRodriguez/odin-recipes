        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>
            A dish featuring either beef or pork meatballs, which are coated in a vibrant,
            tangy-sweet sauce. The sauce is a combination of a sweet component like sugar, 
            honey, or even fruit preserves, with a sour element like vinegar, lemon juice, 
            or pineapple juice.
        </p>

            <li>3 tablespoons soy sauce</li>

            <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>4 slices fresh pineapple, cut into pieces</li>
            <li>1 large green bell pepper, cut into thin strips</li>
            <li>1/4 carrot, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>1/3 onion, cut into wedges and separated</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>
                In a mixing bowl, combine the ground beef, egg, cornstarch, 
                salt, diced onion and pepper. Form into 1-inch meatballs; you'll 
                get about 20 total.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a large skillet over medium heat, brown the meatballs; drain fat 
                and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat the oil in a large saucepan over low heat. Pour in the pineapple 
                juice and simmer for a few minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a small bowl, combine the 3 tablespoons of cornstarch, soy sauce, 
                vinegar and water. Stir until smooth and pour into the pineapple juice. 
                Add the sugar and simmer until thickened, stirring constantly.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place the meatballs, pineapple pieces, green pepper, carrot, and onion into
                the sauce mixture. Heat thoroughly.
            </li>
        </ol>
